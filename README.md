Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I got completely lost after I finished all the videos, I was not able to figure out how to do the required options, I got behind in the class and was completly lost at this point, I know is my fault and I should try to keep up as much as possible. I had a rough week so I will try to figure the rest of the assignment next week, sorry for the awful submission.
